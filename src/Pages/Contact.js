            <p>
              I am a full stack web developer with a background in, and a passion for, medicine and finance. With some previous self-taught experience 
              in JavaScript through FreeCodeCamp, I learned full stack web development through Flatiron Schoolâ€™s intensive, in-person bootcamp. 
              I bring strong skills in programming, leadership, teamwork, communication, organization, self-motivation, and presentation to the table. 
              All of those skills are from first-hand experience, and they will help, and have already helped, companies with big ideas change the world.

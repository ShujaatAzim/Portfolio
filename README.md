This is my personal portfolio website, built with React.

Will be changing a lot of things, and will always be a work in progress.

Before it is deployed, this is how you can access it:

1) Pull down most recent commit.
2) Run 'npm install' to keep up with any changes in dependencies.
3) Run 'npm start' and wait for it to load!

Thank you for taking a look! :)
